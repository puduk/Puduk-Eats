# üçî‚ú® Puduk Eats
üõ†Ô∏è A handmade terminal-based restaurant & order ecosystem built with pure C++ and file-based logic ‚Äî no SQL, no GUI, just pointer magic.

---
## Made by [puduk](https://github.com/puduk)
---

A fully-functional fast food simulation system designed for terminal use only.  
Everything ‚Äî from accounts to recipes, stock to promotions ‚Äî is handled using `.txt` files and raw pointer-based dynamic memory.

üíª ‚Äî built as a pointer challenge project, future versions will clean up and modularize the code.

---

## üî• Core Features

### üë• Account System  
üßë‚Äçüç≥ Create & login as Customer or Restaurant Owner  
üîê Password-protected access  
üßæ Forgot Password system for both user types  
üìÇ Each account has its own unique .txt file  
üö´ Duplicate checks prevent reused usernames and restaurant name

---

### üçΩÔ∏è Customer Panel  
üõí Order food (reads recipe, updates stock dynamically)  
üìú View order history (auto-logged with timestamps)  
üí≥ Top-up account & save card data  
üè† Change delivery address or phone number  
üß† ‚ÄúSuggest Me a Meal‚Äù ‚Äî fun mini test for recommendations  
üè∑Ô∏è Apply promo code (only once per code)  
üõ†Ô∏è Contact customer service (anonymous problem report)  
‚≠ê Rate the app on exit

---

### üè¢ Restaurant Panel  
‚ûï Add new product (name, price, calories, allergy, portion)  
‚ùå Delete product (removed from list)  
üîÅ Update product portion or price  
üì¶ Check & update stock (auto-checked per recipe when ordered)  
üéÅ Create and list promo codes  
üö¶ Open or close restaurant status  
üóÇÔ∏è All restaurant data saved in their own .txt files

---

## üì¶ Recipe System  
üìÅ Each product has its own `.txt` recipe file  
‚ûï Dynamic array to hold ingredients ‚Äî initial size: 5  
üìè Auto-resizes if more than 5 ingredients are needed  
üîÑ Full pointer control (heap allocation & deletion)

---

## üí≥ Top-Up & Card Storage  
üí∞ Balance updates shown live after orders and promotions  
üí≥ Saved cards stored securely in user files  
üìé Reusable during checkout without re-entering card data

---

## ‚≠ê App Rating System  
üìù Before quitting, both customers and restaurants are asked to rate  
üìà Scores stored and reviewed from `customer_rate.txt` and `restaurant_rate.txt`

---

## üìÅ File-Based Storage  
‚úÖ No SQL or external DBs  
üìÇ All data handled via structured `.txt` files  
üßº Clear separators (like /-/) used for clean parsing  
üß† Dynamically processed at runtime using file I/O

---

## üß† Code Structure & Practices  
üîó All data is dynamically allocated on the heap using raw pointers  
üßÉ Manual use of `new` and `delete` ‚Äî no vectors, no arrays, no structs  
üõ†Ô∏è Pure OOP with multiple `.cpp` and `.hpp` modules  
üß™ Manually tested ‚Äî stable memory usage, no leaks  
üìã Modular menus with full logic flow control

---

## üß† Purpose  
This project was developed as a personal challenge to master pointer management, heap memory, and text-based data handling.  
The goal was to simulate a working app **without databases, structs, or helper libraries**.

---

## üå± Planned Upgrades (Summer or Fall 2025)

üñ•Ô∏è GUI Version using Qt   
üìê Code cleanup and reduction of pointer overuse  
üîó SQL-based backend version  
üåç Multi-language support: üáπüá∑ Turkish, üá∑üá∫ Russian, üáµüá± Polish  
üß© Modular architecture and class separation  
üìä Analytics dashboard for restaurant owners

---

## üíª Tech Stack

- üöÄ C++ (OOP, File I/O, Pointers)
- üìü 100% Terminal UI
- üîÅ No third-party libraries
- üß† Heap-only data storage
- üìÅ Plaintext `.txt` database

---


## üí° Notes

- ‚úÖ Project contains **68 files** including `.cpp` & `.hpp`
- üîÅ Data fully preserved between sessions using file I/O
- ‚è±Ô∏è Created from scratch in **~17 Hours** of focused coding


---

## üß† Advanced Concepts & Code Practices

- üîó All data is dynamically allocated on the **heap** using raw pointers  
- üß† Maximum usage of `new` / `delete` and deep manual memory management  
- üö´ No use of helper tools like `struct`, `vector`, `array`, or `smart pointers`  
- üßº Code was repeatedly tested ‚Äî **no discovered memory leaks**  
- üõ† Designed with a deep focus on logic, control flow, and data isolation  
- üßÉ Pure, pointer-based simulation ‚Äî zero shortcuts

---

## ü§ñ AI Support (1%)


This project was 99% handwritten with manual logic and file design.  
Approximately 1% of assistance was provided by ChatGPT for **logic validation**, **debugging ideas**, and for generating **test questions and results** used in the *"Suggest Me a Meal"* feature.

> ‚ùå No AI-generated code was copied or directly implemented ‚Äî all logic was self-written and fully understood.

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Timeline  
üß† Development Time: ~3 Days  
üí• This project stands as one of the largest ‚Äî 3,300+ lines in a single app

---

Crafted by a student with just 1 month of C++ experience in 3 days.
